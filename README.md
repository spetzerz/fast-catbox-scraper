A piece of software written in C + WinAPI featuring multithreding to scan the website https://files.catbox.moe
for files, with custom extensions

**As of now, to change settings, go into main.c and backend.c to change settings.** THIS IS REQUIRED IF YOU WANT TO USE IT!
I will add a way to customize settings easier, but that later.
